Being an applied mathematician, he recommended I study a very specific inequality called Gårding’s inequality.
If you would like to learn more about Gårding’s inequality itself, my paper has all the details about it, the prerequisites to understand it, and an application. In fact, most of the paper covers the necessary material needed to understand what the inequality is even saying (PDE analysis seems to be a lot less abstract than other fields, considering all the machinery I needed).</description></item></channel></rss>
