Being an applied mathematician, he recommended I study a very specific inequality called Gårding’s inequality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you would like to learn more about Gårding’s inequality itself, my &lt;a href="https://pr4-kp.github.io/pdf/math521/gardings_inequality_521.pdf">paper&lt;/a> has all the details about it, the prerequisites to understand it, and an application. In fact, most of the paper covers the necessary material needed to understand what the inequality is even saying (PDE analysis seems to be a lot less abstract than other fields, considering all the machinery I needed). However, for a blog post, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to bog down any actual interesting results by trying to describe how this inequality functions. This will only focus on the broader subject of weak solutions to PDEs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
