However, before I can do that, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what ends are in a graph theory perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="what-are-ends"&gt;What are ends?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;strong&gt;ends&lt;/strong&gt; is a little confusing, because they don&amp;rsquo;t really represent the &amp;ldquo;end&amp;rdquo; of a graph, at least not how we would define an end in real life. Think of a rope. If two teams were playing tug of war on that rope, we know that it has two ends that the opposite teams would tug on. Now if this rope is of finite length (it probably is), then we would typically call the two points at the end of the rope the ends (obviously).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
