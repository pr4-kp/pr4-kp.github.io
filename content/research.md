## Papers

- [**Classification of Finite Groups With Equal Left and Right Quotient Sets**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04717)\
   _with Haran Mouli_.\
   _Preprint_.

  - We have been made aware of the paper by Marcel Herzog, Gil Kaplan, Patrizia Longobardi, and Mercede Maj: ["Products of subsets of groups by their inverses,"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13366-013-0141-y) which agrees with our main result and extends it to infinite groups. We are grateful to Liubomir Chiriac for showing us this result.
