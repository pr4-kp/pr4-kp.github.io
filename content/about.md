👋🏽 Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Pramana Saldin and I am a fourth-year at the University of Wisconsin.
I am a [Barry Goldwater Scholar](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/). I'm interested in algebra.

For the details of this site: I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with a modified [Archie theme](https://github.com/athul/archie). This site is deployed through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

If you want to reach out, you can contact me on my [Mathstodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/@pramana) or by email: `[lastname] [at] wisc [dot] edu`.
