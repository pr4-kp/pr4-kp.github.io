# MATH 741 and 742: Abstract algebra I and II

- Notes ([PDF](/pdf/math741/main_741-742.pdf))

# MATH 721: A first course in real analysis

- Notes ([PDF](/pdf/math721/main_721.pdf))

# Modular forms

- I gave a talk at UW's Undergraduate Math Club on modular forms. The talk is largely based on [Professor Keith Conrad's CTNT summer school](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJUSzeW191Qx_rdAS8sd4nTNlSyLt97Q4). ([Slides](/pdf/modular_forms.pdf))

# Algebraic geometry

- Resultants and Elimination Theory ([PDF](/pdf/resultants_and_elimination_theory.pdf))
  - Expository paper from a directed study in algebraic geometry under [Professor Brian Lawrence](https://people.math.wisc.edu/lawrence/). The resultant allow us to check if the polynomials $f$ and $g$ share a root just using their coefficients. Using these ideas, we can prove a more general theorem in algebraic geometry called the _fundamental theorem of elimination theory_.

# MATH 531: Probability theory

- Notes ([PDF](/pdf/math531/main_531.pdf))

# MATH 621: Introduction to manifolds

- Final paper - Swan's theorem ([PDF](/pdf/math621/swans-theorem.pdf))
  - **Abstract.** Swan’s theorem establishes a module structure on the set of smooth sections over a vector bundle $\pi\colon E\to M$.
    This allows us to study algebra by means
    of vector bundles and vice-versa. We conclude with an introductory result in K-theory that follows from this theorem

# MATH 542: Modern algebra II

- Notes ([PDF](/pdf/math542/main_542.pdf))

# MATH 522: Analysis II

- Notes ([PDF](/pdf/math522/main_522.pdf))

# MATH 514: Numerical analysis

- Notes ([PDF](/pdf/math514/main_514.pdf))

# MATH 521: Analysis I

- Notes ([PDF](/pdf/math521/main_521.pdf)) ([TeX](/pdf/math521/main_521.tex))
- Final paper – Gårding's Inequality ([PDF](/pdf/math521/gardings_inequality_521.pdf)) ([TeX](/pdf/math521/main_honors_paper.tex))
  - **Abstract.** This is an expository paper on the prerequisites for Gårding’s inequality.
    Proposed by Lars Gårding, this inequality has applications in the
    study of weak solutions to elliptic partial differential equations.
    We will give the prerequisites to
    state Gårding’s inequality and give one application.

# MATH 475: Introduction to combinatorics

- Notes (Chapter 14: Burnside's Lemma and Polya Counting) ([PDF](/pdf/math475/main_475.pdf))

# MATH 531 (UWM): Modern Algebra

- Notes ([PDF](/pdf/math531uwm/MATH-531-Notes.pdf))
