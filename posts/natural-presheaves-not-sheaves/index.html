While the first half of the chapter serves to introduce the idea of a sheaf and to convince you that it makes sense geometrically to define it, I would say the meat of the chapter is defining the <em>sheafification</em> of a presheaf and explain how it helps us do homology on sheaves.</p><h2 id=presheaves-and-sheaves>Presheaves and sheaves</h2><p>This year, my courses have been filled with categorical language, so this post will be more abstract than usual.</p><blockquote class=Definition><p><b>Definition</b><b> (Presheaf)</b><b>.</b><p>Let $X$ be a topological space.

It will be somewhat unintuitive to think of presheaves that do not satisfy the identity axiom. Indeed, if the sections of a sheaf are functions, we can define the restriction map $\mathrm{res}^U_V$ as restricting a function on $U$ to $V$. This sheaf satisfies the identity axiom. We&rsquo;ll try to find a sheaf of functions that fails gluability.</p><blockquote class=Example><p><b>Example</b><b> (Logarithms???)</b><b>.</b><p>First, a quick return to algebraic topology. We know that simply-connected spaces are not closed under unions. Proof by picture:
<img src=/img/natural-presheaves-not-sheaves/simply-connected-not-implies-connected.png alt></p><p>($\pi_1(A) = \pi_1(B) = 0$, but $\pi_1(A\cup B) = \Z$). Therefore,
if we got a presheaf of &ldquo;functions that are only defined on simply-connected regions,&rdquo; then it would not be a sheaf.</p><p>Such an example comes out of complex analysis:</p><p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ be a simply-connected open set with $0\notin \Omega$ and $1\in \Omega$. Then there is a branch of the logarithm on $\Omega$: $F(z) = \log_{\Omega}(z)$ such that</p><ol><li>$F$ is holomorphic on $\Omega$,</li><li>$e^{F(z)} = z$ for all $z\in \Omega$,</li><li>$F(r) = \log{r}$ on the real axis near $1$.</li></ol><p>The idea with the proof is to let $F$ be the primitive of $1/z$ in $\Omega$. This is well-defined because $0\notin \Omega$, so we may define</p><p>$$
F(z) := \int_{\gamma}\frac{1}{z}dz,
$$</p><p>where $\gamma$ is any curve from $1$ to $z$. We use simply-connectedness to guarantee this integral makes sense (for example, if the region was $\mathbb{C}-\{0\}$, then the trivial loop gives the value $0$, but the loop around the singularity at $\{0\}$ gives $2\pi i$ by the residue theorem).</p><p>So here&rsquo;s our example: let $\mathscr{F}$ be the presheaf of functions that admit a holomorphic logarithm. The presheaf checks are clear, since we are working with a presheaf of functions. However, there exist log branches of $z$ in the simply-connected regions</p><p>$$
(\mathbb{C}-\{0\}) \cap \{z : \mathrm{Im}(z) > -0.01\}, \qquad(\mathbb{C}-\{0\}) \cap \{z : \mathrm{Im}(z) &lt; 0.01\},
$$</p><p>but not in their union $\mathbb{C}-\{0\}$. Indeed, it would be the primitive of $1/z$, so over the circle $S^1$ (oriented counter clockwise),</p><p>$$
\int_{S^1}\frac{1}{z} = F(1) - F(1) = 0.
$$</p><p>On the other hand, one can compute directly</p><p>$$
\int_{S^1}\frac{1}{z} = 2\pi i.
$$</p><p>So no such logarithm exists, and the gluability axiom fails.</p></p></blockquote><blockquote class=Example><p><b>Example</b><b>.</b><p>A similar result to the previous theorem is that if $f\colon \Omega \to \mathbb{C}$ is a non-zero holomorphic function on a simply-connected open set $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C}$, then it admits a holomorphic logarithm.</p><p>The proof comes from defining the logarithm $g$ as</p><p>$$
g(z) := \int_{\gamma}\frac{f^\prime(w)}{f(w)}dw.
$$</p><p>Well-definedness comes from simply-connectedness and $f$ being nonzero.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll now fit this example in a general framework.
Let $\mathscr{O}_\mathbb{C}$ be the sheaf of holomorphic functions,
$\mathscr{O}_\mathbb{C}^*$ the sheaf of <em>nonzero</em> holomorphic functions, and $\underline{\Z}$ be the <strong>constant sheaf</strong> (sections are locally constant maps $U\to \Z$). Then we have a sequence of sheaves of abelian groups</p><p>$$
0 \to \underline{\Z} \xrightarrow{\times 2\pi i} \mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{C}} \xrightarrow{\exp} \mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{C}}^* \to 1.
$$</p><p>However, this fails to be short exact on sections for the same reason as before: on $\mathbb{C}-\{0\}$, the nonzero function $z$ does <em>not</em> admit a holomorphic logarithm, so the last map is not surjective! So our previous example was just the <strong>image presheaf</strong> of $\mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{C}}$.</p><p>This sequence is nearly short exact. If $U$ is simply-connected, then the maps of sections form a short exact sequence by the previous theorem.</p><p>We notice that locally (on germs), the map is surjective, so we may need to define a new notion of exactness. This leads to <a href=https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/007X><strong>sheafification</strong></a>.</p></p></blockquote><h2 id=silly-remarks>Silly remarks</h2><p>I wrote this blog post over spring break, and I hoped to include more examples of presheaves that were not sheaves so that I could better understand sheafification. As I progressed through the chapter, I realized that the one example Vakil gives seems the most geometric. I did come up with some honorable mentions though</p><ul><li>Any presheaf where the condition on sections is related to counting, e.g., the presheaf of real-valued functions on $\R^n$ exactly one zero is not a sheaf. In fact, the presheaf of real-valued functions on $\R^n$ with finitely many zeros is not a sheaf.</li><li>On a non-orientable manifold $M$ (e.g. a Möbius band), let sections over $U$ be non-vanishing top forms. <strong>Warning: this is actually a sheaf, since the gluing axiom does actually hold for $k$-forms on manifolds.</strong> I was hoping this would fail for similar reasons to the logarithms example, since a non-orientable manifold is the union of orientable manifolds.</li></ul><h2 id=some-motivation-for-the-zariski-topology>Some motivation for the Zariski topology</h2><p>People who have been though classical algebraic geometry are immediately told about the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zariski_topology>Zariski topology</a>, which, for example, give a topology to $k$ for any field $k$.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at the field $\R$. Perhaps naively, we try to use the regular topology $\mathcal{T}_{\rm{reg}}$ (i.e. the one you learn in analysis: open sets are sets where every point is interior) to form a sheaf, where the sections over $U \subseteq \R$ are polynomials in $\R[x]$ restricted to $U$.</p><p>However, gluability fails again! The problem is that we are letting too many sets be open. For example, consider the intervals $\dots,(-1,1),(1,3),(3,5)\dots$. On $(n-1,n+1)$, the polynomial $x-n \in \R[x]$ has one zero and is not identically zero. However, we vacuously should be able to glue these polynomials, since the intervals $\{(n-1,n+1) : n \in 2\Z\}$ are disjoint. On the other hand, such a section has infinitely many zeros but is nonzero, which is impossible for a polynomial.</p><p>If we instead equip $\R$ with the Zariski topology $\mathcal{T}_{\rm zar}$, we know that closed sets are either $\R$ or finite sets, so we won&rsquo;t be able to union infinitely many disjoint sets as before.
In fact, we actually <em>do</em> get a sheaf. One possible explanation is analytic: if we have two sections $p_1, p_2$ over the open sets $U_1,U_2$, respectively, then they agree on all but finitely many points. But $p_1$ and $p_2$ are restrictions of continuous functions on $\R$, so they must arise from restricting the same underlying function. We&rsquo;re essentially adding the removable discontinuities back.</p><figure><img src=/img/natural-presheaves-not-sheaves/zariski.png alt="The sections $p_1$ and $p_2$ clearly arise from the same continuous function."><figcaption><p>The sections $p_1$ and $p_2$ clearly arise from the same continuous function.</p></figcaption></figure><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Of course, if the topology is not discrete, then the property becomes more subtle.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/algebraic-geometry>algebraic geometry</a></li><li><a href=/tags/complex-analysis>complex analysis</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/pr4-kp/ rel=me title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a></div><div class=footer-info>| 2025 © Pramana | <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer><script>feather.replace()</script></div></body></html>
