While the first half of the chapter serves to introduce the idea of a sheaf and to convince you that it makes sense geometrically to define it, I would say the meat of the chapter is defining the &lt;em>sheafification&lt;/em> of a presheaf and explain how it helps us do homology on sheaves.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Can a machine learn mathematical structure?</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/machine-learning-sl2z/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/machine-learning-sl2z/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I think of machine learning, I tend to think about &lt;strong>estimation&lt;/strong>; a machine learning algorithm is a method of estimating a function given a (usually large) set of data. As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve primarily seen machine learning used when the function we are trying to estimate is assumed to be continuous (or differentiable, smooth, etc.), because then you can use nice results from analysis to prove convergence. But algebraic structures like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory">&lt;strong>groups&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> can be discrete objects, where there is no way to smoothly interpolate between two group elements. Moreover, groups adhere to very strict rules that dictate how they can be studied, which makes this continuous way of thinking hard to apply &amp;ndash; I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine that a machine learning model, just armed with data about groups, functions between them, and some backpropagation, could reach the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism_theorems">isomorphism theorems&lt;/a>. Despite this, the research I did last semester opened my mind more to using classical machine learning methods to get structure of discrete groups, given that we ask train the machine on the right questions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why homology is weaker than homotopy</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/same-homology-different-homotopy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/same-homology-different-homotopy/</guid><description>&lt;p>The main two flavors of invariants in an introductory algebraic topology class are the homology groups associated with a space and the homotopy groups (typically just the first homotopy group, $\pi_1$). The fundamental group is formed by looking at loops starting at a certain point. Similarly, the homotopy groups look at cycles, which can be thought of as loops that commute. Because of these similarities, I wondered about which one was &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; at differentiating topological spaces.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding exact sequences</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/exact-sequence/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/exact-sequence/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a motivating question I had from group theory: if $N \trianglelefteq G$ is a normal subgroup,
is it necessarily true that $G\cong G/N\times N$? Looking at non-abelian groups quickly shows that the answer is no (take the dihedral group $D_3=\langle r,t \mid r^3=t^2=1, rt=tr^{-1}\rangle$ and
the normal subgroup $\langle r\rangle\cong \mathbb{Z}/3$).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I later learned about &lt;strong>semidirect products&lt;/strong> $\rtimes_\phi$, which generalize the direct product $\times$. But even this was
insufficient to describe group decompositions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My first CTF: HackMIT 2023's puzzle</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/hackmit-solutions-2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/hackmit-solutions-2023/</guid><description>&lt;p>On July 4th, MIT emailed all applicants to their &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon?oldformat=true">hackathon&lt;/a>, HackMIT, that they have started a puzzle, where the &lt;strong>top 50&lt;/strong> competitors would be granted admission into HackMIT.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Taking their advice, I went to checking the website. In the FAQ section, I noticed something new:&lt;/p>

While working through the exercises, I saw an interesting way of viewing closed and open subsets of the prime spectrum that borrowed ideals from combinatorics.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-is-the-prime-spectrum-of-a-ring">What is the prime spectrum of a ring?&lt;/h1>
&lt;blockquote

 &lt;p>
 &lt;b>Definition&lt;/b>&lt;b> (Prime ideal)&lt;/b>&lt;b>.&lt;/b>
 &lt;p>An &lt;strong>ideal&lt;/strong> $\mathfrak{a}$ of a ring $A$ is a &lt;strong>subring&lt;/strong> (a subset of $A$ that is still a ring under $A$&amp;rsquo;s operations) that has the property that any $a\in A$ times $p\in \mathfrak{a}$ has $ap\in \mathfrak{a}$ as well. That is, the elements in the ideal stay in the ideal after multiplying by any element of $A$.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visualizing horospheres on hyperbolic groups</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/horospheres-project/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/horospheres-project/</guid><description>&lt;p>This semester I was able to participate in our undergradute research lab, and, relevant to my past work,
our project was in the field of geometric group
theory. I plan on introducing our project and go over some topics in geometric group theory I haven&amp;rsquo;t covered before.
This project was joint work with Noah Jillson and Katerina Stuopis with our advisors Daniel Levitin and Tullia Dymarz.&lt;/p>

Being an applied mathematician, he recommended I study a very specific inequality called Gårding’s inequality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you would like to learn more about Gårding’s inequality itself, my &lt;a href="https://pr4-kp.github.io/pdf/math521/gardings_inequality_521.pdf">paper&lt;/a> has all the details about it, the prerequisites to understand it, and an application. In fact, most of the paper covers the necessary material needed to understand what the inequality is even saying (PDE analysis seems to be a lot less abstract than other fields, considering all the machinery I needed). However, for a blog post, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to bog down any actual interesting results by trying to describe how this inequality functions. This will only focus on the broader subject of weak solutions to PDEs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Group structures</title><link>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/group-structures/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pr4-kp.github.io/posts/group-structures/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on Beachy and Blair&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.johnabeachy.com/">Abstract Algebra Book&lt;/a>,
specifically their chapter on Group structure (7), and I wanted to summarize what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about group structures.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="finite-groups-and-structure">Finite groups and structure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The problems and results derived from this chapter almost all concern with finite groups. We know &lt;em>a lot&lt;/em> about finite groups. For example, we have this result:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote 
 class="Theorem">
 &lt;p>
 &lt;b>Theorem&lt;/b>&lt;b> (Burnside, 1904)&lt;/b>&lt;b>.&lt;/b>
 Every group of order $p^a q^b$, where $p$ and $q$ are (not necessarily distinct) primes is solvable.

However, before I can do that, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what ends are in a graph theory perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-are-ends">What are ends?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The word &lt;strong>ends&lt;/strong> is a little confusing, because they don&amp;rsquo;t really represent the &amp;ldquo;end&amp;rdquo; of a graph, at least not how we would define an end in real life. Think of a rope. If two teams were playing tug of war on that rope, we know that it has two ends that the opposite teams would tug on. Now if this rope is of finite length (it probably is), then we would typically call the two points at the end of the rope the ends (obviously).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
