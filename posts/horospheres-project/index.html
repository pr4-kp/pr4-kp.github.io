our project was in the field of geometric group
theory. I plan on introducing our project and go over some topics in geometric group theory I haven&rsquo;t covered before.
This project was joint work with Noah Jillson and Katerina Stuopis with our advisors Daniel Levitin and Tullia Dymarz.</p><p>If you want to skip the mathematical jargon and see the results, skip to the end.</p><h1 id=hyperbolic-geometry>Hyperbolic geometry</h1><p><strong>Hyperbolic geometry</strong> is an important part of <em>non-Euclidean geometry</em>,
where we study spaces that do not satisfy the postulates of Euclidean
geometry. In particular,
hyperbolic spaces replace Euclid&rsquo;s fifth postulate with
&ldquo;given a line $L$, and a point $P$ not on $L$, there are <em>multiple</em> lines
that are parallel to $L$ and pass through $P$.&rdquo;</p><p>A consequence of this is that hyperbolic space has negative curvature.
Intuitively, this means that as
go off from a point in two directions, you will end up very far apart. All
points in hyperbolic space &ldquo;look like&rdquo; a saddle point.
There
are many ways to represent the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$, one of which is shown in the following figure. However, we are forced to embed them into $\mathbb{R}^2$, so properties like distance and size are not as they appear.</p><figure><img src=/img/horospheres-project/Tessellation-of-hyperbolic-plane-by-right-angled-pentagons.png alt="Figure.

They formalize the idea of taking a sphere &ldquo;to infinity.&rdquo;
Formally, we take a <strong>geodesic ray</strong> $\gamma\colon[0,\infty)\to H$, where $H$ is a hyperbolic space.
A <em>geodesic</em> is a path from one point to another where the
path is as small as possible. The ray just has the property that any subset of $\gamma$ is a geodesic as well.</p><figure><img src=/img/horospheres-project/horosphere.png alt="Figure. The (zero-)horosphere along the ray $\color{Goldenrod}\gamma$ is $\color{RoyalBlue}\mathcal{H}$" width=500><figcaption><p><strong>Figure.</strong> The (zero-)horosphere along the ray $\color{Goldenrod}\gamma$ is $\color{RoyalBlue}\mathcal{H}$</p></figcaption></figure><p>To formally find all points at this horosphere, we need to use a <strong>Busemann function</strong> of $\gamma$ relative to $x_0$,
which is defined as
$$
b_{\gamma,x_0}(x) \coloneqq \lim_{t\to \infty}d(x,\gamma(t))-d(x_0,\gamma(t)).
$$
The zero set (the set of all $x$ so that the function evalautes to $0$) is called the <strong>$0$-horosphere</strong>. It will be assumed that
all horospheres mentioned are $0$-horospheres.</p><h2 id=our-groups-of-study-right-angled-coxeter-groups>Our groups of study: Right-Angled Coxeter Groups</h2><p>Recall that we can turn groups into labeled, directed graphs through their <strong>Cayley graph</strong>. By observing the geometric properties of the
Cayley graph, we can get algebraic ideas about the group itself (see <a href=..//graphgroupends>ends</a>).
A <strong>hyperbolic group</strong> has a hyperbolic Cayley graph. Thus, we can find horospheres on these Cayley graphs.</p><blockquote class=Definition><p><b>Definition</b><b> (Right-Angled Coxeter Groups)</b><b>.</b>
Given a <strong>defining graph</strong> $\Gamma$, which consists of vertices $V$ and edges $E$, we define its associated <strong>Right-Angled Coxeter Group (RACG)</strong> as the presentation
$$
W_{\Gamma} \coloneqq \langle V \mid {\color{LimeGreen}v^2}, {\color{violet}[v_1,v_2]} : v\in V, (v_1,v_2) \in E \rangle.
$$</p></blockquote><p>We will refer to $V$ as the <strong>letters</strong> of $W_{\Gamma}$, and any combination of letters as a <strong>word</strong> (which is also a group element!).
The most important parts of this definition is that
$\color{LimeGreen}\text{letters cancel if written twice}$, and
$\color{violet}\text{letters commute if they are an edge in the defining graph}$.</p><blockquote class=Example><p><b>Example</b><b> (Pentagon graph)</b><b>.</b>
RACGs tend to represent reflections. In fact, we can relate our group to reflections along the hyperbolic plane.
For example, for the tiling shown in the first figure, there is a RACG that represents the reflections along the lines between pentagons.
Its defining graph is shown below.</p></blockquote><figure class=invert><img src=/img/horospheres-project/pentagon.png alt="Figure. Defining graph for symmetries of a $5$-square tiling of $\mathbb{H}^2$." width=333><figcaption><p><strong>Figure.</strong> Defining graph for symmetries of a $5$-square tiling of $\mathbb{H}^2$.</p></figcaption></figure><p>In order to make sure our groups are hyperbolic, we need the following
theorem.</p><blockquote class=Theorem><p><b>Theorem</b><b> (Moussong)</b><b>.</b>
A RACG is hyperbolic if and only if its defining graph does not have a
square.</p></blockquote><p>We can prove this in one direction easily.
If we assume that the RACG has a square, then we can find a subgroup
that is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}$. This is non-hyperbolic, and will therefore violate our requirements for hyperbolicity.</p><p>Because of this, we have to make sure that our defining graphs do not have any squares.</p><h1 id=methods-discretizing-horospheres>Methods: discretizing horospheres</h1><p>To create our horosphere on RACGs, we first wanted to find a point on the horosphere, and try to expand outwards.
We could ran a program to find other words also on the horosphere.
To make sure that we didn&rsquo;t repeat words (like $ab$ and $ba$), we
set an <em>order</em> $&lt;$ on equivalent words called <strong>ShortLex</strong>, which
essentially found the shortest, then lexicographically first way to
write a word.
We would let the program run out to some length and then have it return a list of the words it found.</p><p>However, we ended up just having a list of words, but with no clear relation. Our next task was to combine them into a discrete graph.
Since words of the horosphere were even distance apart (with respect to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_metric>word metric</a>),
we connected words that were exactly $2$ apart. In many cases, this connected our graph, and gave some idea of the structure of the horosphere.</p><p>Our main work this semester was to extend our program to work with much more complex defining graphs. One defining graph we chose was
a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_(topology)>triangulation</a> of a torus, which had $21$ nodes.</p><h1 id=results>Results</h1><p>We were able to put the horosphere data in Mathematica to get pictures of the horospheres.</p><figure><img src=/img/horospheres-project/Pentagon_Len_4.png alt="Figure. Length $4$ horosphere of the pentagon defining graph." width=550><figcaption><p><strong>Figure.</strong> Length $4$ horosphere of the pentagon defining graph.</p></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/img/horospheres-project/Length3_Horosphere_2D.jpg alt="Figure. Length $3$ horosphere of the torus triangulation defining graph."><figcaption><p><strong>Figure.</strong> Length $3$ horosphere of the torus triangulation defining graph.</p></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/img/horospheres-project/theta_graph-len5.png alt="Figure. Length $5$ horosphere of another defining graph (we call it the theta graph because it looks like the letter $\Theta$)."><figcaption><p><strong>Figure.</strong> Length $5$ horosphere of another defining graph (we call it the <em>theta graph</em> because it looks like the letter $\Theta$).</p></figcaption></figure><h1 id=discussion>Discussion</h1><p>We know that finitely generated groups can have either $0$, $1$, $2$, or $\infty$ <strong>ends</strong> on their Cayley graphs.
The horosphere however, is not the entire Cayley graph. We found it can have more interesting numbers of ends
(such as $3$ in the $\Theta$ graph).
We can prove the number of ends a horosphere is based on our defining graph and which ray we choose, and we now visualize this.</p><p>Generating a finite part of the horosphere on a group gives us a discrete visualization of the <strong>boundary</strong> of that group.
The boundary is the set of geodesic rays with the equivalence relation $\sim$ between rays if they are &ldquo;going the same direction.&rdquo;
The boundary of a hyperbolic space minus a point looks similar to these finite horospheres. In fact, the boundaries of some of our RACGs can be understood as homeomorphic to one of three objects: a $2$-sphere, and <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13315.pdf>two fractal-like surfaces</a>.</p><p>The horosphere of the pentagon defining graph looks like a line because the boundary of the group is a circle, and a circle minus a point
can be stretched to look like (is <strong>homeomorphic</strong> to) a line.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/geometric-group-theory>geometric group theory</a></li><li><a href=/tags/hyperbolic-geometry>hyperbolic geometry</a></li><li><a href=/tags/research>research</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/pr4-kp/ rel=me title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a></div><div class=footer-info>| 2023 © Pramana | <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer><script>feather.replace()</script></div></body></html>
